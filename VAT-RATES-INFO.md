## How It Works

### Import Process
1. Navigate to **EU VAT Guard > VAT Rate Importer** in your WordPress admin
2. Select the countries you want to import rates for
3. Choose whether to include special VAT categories
4. Click "Import Selected VAT Rates"

### WooCommerce Integration
- Creates or updates tax rates in WooCommerce tax tables
- Standard rates get priority 1, reduced rates get priority 2
- Special rates create separate tax classes (e.g., "food", "books")
- Automatically clears WooCommerce tax cache

### Tax Class Assignment
After importing, you can assign the new tax classes to products:
1. Go to **Products > Edit Product**
2. In the **General** tab, find **Tax Class**
3. Select the appropriate class (e.g., "Food (Belgium)" for 6% rate)

## Best Practices

### Before Importing
- Backup your WooCommerce tax settings
- Review your current tax configuration
- Ensure your store's base country is correctly set

### After Importing
- Review the imported rates in **WooCommerce > Settings > Tax**
- Test checkout with different countries and tax classes
- Update product tax classes as needed

### Maintenance
- VAT rates can change (though rarely)
- Re-run the importer to update rates when needed
- The tool will update existing rates rather than duplicate them

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No countries showing**
- Check that countries are enabled in **WooCommerce > Settings > General > Selling locations**

**Rates not applying at checkout**
- Verify tax calculation is enabled in WooCommerce
- Check that customer's country matches imported rates
- Ensure products have correct tax class assigned

**Duplicate rates**
- The importer prevents duplicates by checking existing rates
- If you see duplicates, they may have been created manually
