# Release Notes - Version 1.3.0

**Release Date:** January 29, 2025

## 🎉 What's New in Version 1.3.0

This is a major code quality and maintainability release that brings professional-grade code structure to EU VAT Guard for WooCommerce. While there are no new user-facing features, this release significantly improves the plugin's foundation for future development.

## 🔧 Major Improvements

### Proper PHP Namespacing
All plugin classes now use the `Stormlabs\EUVATGuard` namespace, following modern PHP and WordPress best practices. This prevents potential conflicts with other plugins and themes.

**Before:**
```php
class EU_VAT_Guard { }
```

**After:**
```php
namespace Stormlabs\EUVATGuard;
class VAT_Guard { }
```

### Comprehensive Constants
Added well-organized constants for better code maintainability:
- Plugin constants (version, paths, URLs)
- Option name constants (all WordPress options)
- Meta key constants (user and order meta)

### Enhanced Code Organization
- Proper use statements for WordPress and WooCommerce classes
- Improved code structure following WordPress Coding Standards
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced code documentation

## 🌍 Translation Updates

Completed missing translations for:
- **Dutch (nl_NL)** - 100% complete
- **French (fr_FR)** - 100% complete  
- **German (de_DE)** - Significantly improved

All admin interface strings are now properly translated in these languages.

## 🎨 User Interface Improvements

### Admin Order Edit Enhancement
The VAT number field in the admin order edit screen now intelligently displays:
- **View Mode**: Shows VAT number as read-only text
- **Edit Mode**: Shows editable input field (after clicking the pencil icon)

This matches WooCommerce's native behavior for address fields and provides a cleaner interface.

## 📚 Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation:
- **NAMESPACE-CHANGES.md** - Details about the namespace implementation
- **NAMING-CONVENTIONS.md** - Complete guide for naming conventions
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Detailed version history
- **RELEASE-NOTES-1.3.0.md** - This document

## ✅ Backward Compatibility

**100% Backward Compatible** - This release maintains full compatibility with:
- Existing installations
- Third-party integrations
- Custom code using the plugin
- All existing data and settings

A class alias ensures that any code referencing the old `EU_VAT_Guard` class continues to work seamlessly.

## 🔒 Security & Stability

- Enhanced code security through proper namespacing
- Reduced potential for naming conflicts
- Improved code maintainability
- Better error handling
- Cleaner code structure

## 🚀 For Developers

If you're extending this plugin or integrating with it, you can now use:

```php
use Stormlabs\EUVATGuard\VAT_Guard;

// Get plugin instance
$vat_guard = VAT_Guard::instance();
```

Or continue using the old class name (backward compatible):
```php
$vat_guard = EU_VAT_Guard::instance();
```
